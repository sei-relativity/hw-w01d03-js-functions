# JS Functions HW

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Change into the new directory.
1. Create and checkout a new branch, named `response`.
1. When finished, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` to your fork and submit a pull request.

## Questions

1. [Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock%E2%80%93paper%E2%80%93scissors) ([watch the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtcHmiAcbZc))

   - Create a file in this repo named `rps.js`
   - Write a function that takes `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors` as an argument for the user choice, then chooses `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors` randomly for the computer choice, and returns whether the user `win`, `lose`, or `tie`.
   - Example: `playGame('rock') // Computer picked: paper. User picked: rock. User lose.`
   - _**Hint:** Javascript includes a `Math.random` method._

2. Dice Roller

   - Create a file in this repo and name it `dice.js`
   - Write a function that chooses two random numbers (1-6) and returns them. It should also return the sum.
   - Example: `rollDice() // Dice rolled are 6 and 1. Sum is 7`
   - BONUS: have your function take an argument of the # of dice to be rolled.
   - Example: `rollDice(3) // Dice rolled are 4, 2, and 7. Sum is 13.`
